## Contributing

The package is made up of 2 main folders:

- /src contains all the source files and components
- /example is a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/) based demo website

To setup and run a local copy:

1.  Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/viczaca/react-json-schema-builder`
2.  Run `yarn install` in the root folder
3.  Run `yarn install` in the example folder
4.  In seperate terminal windows, run `yarn start` in the root and example folders.

You should now be up and running with live browser reloading of the example website while you work on source files and components in the /src folder.

When you're done working on your changes, submit a PR with the details and include a screenshot if you've changed anything visually.
